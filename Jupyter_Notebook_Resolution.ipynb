    "1. **SQL**: ***Not considered as a program language*** but it's a powerful tool for data science because we need to read, manipulate and analyze data, so how we get that data? the answer is SQL, this tool allow us to built the data with the information that we required stored on a server, with this language we can query data and built the ETL to start working on a poject.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Python**: Most popular language for data science because it's simple to undertand it and program on it, also, integrates a lot of libraries with preaty good documentation and powerful characteristics for data analysis, machine learning, plots, statistics and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **R**: Popular language with powerful tools on the statistic field, allow us to analyze data with statistic without installing other libraries or complements, besides that, it's really good at ploting, have exceptional advange with dinamic plots with libreries like ggplot2.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scala**: Usually associated with machine learning and big data projects due it's great development.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Java**: Special language object oriented, people choose it due the great performance and the ecosystem associated with other apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Julia**: A relative new language in data science, highlights for the great performance associated with mathematics and numerical computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **C++**: Choosen due optimization, strong for computationally intensive task, it's fastest compare with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **JavaScript**: Besides it's usually use on the WEB development are, data scientists use it to integrate the data analysis with data visualization or a easisest way to show and share a project."
